# parcelvue333

Use if you need a quick Vue/Bootstrap4/Sass/TypeScript environment that you can publish at Netlify. You can also work through the howto [Create Parcel/Vue2/Bootstrap4/Sass/TypeScript Site at Netlify](https://onespace.netlify.app/howtos?id=337) to see how this was made. You use [https://createapp.dev/parcel](https://createapp.dev/parcel) so Parcel stays in the background, but that is its nicest feature actually. See the many other options you can add at Create App website e.g. testing with Mocha/Chai, etc.
